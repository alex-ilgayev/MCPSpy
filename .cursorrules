# MCPSpy Project Rules

## Project Overview

MCPSpy is a CLI utility that uses eBPF to monitor MCP (Model Context Protocol) communication by tracking stdio operations and analyzing JSON-RPC 2.0 messages.

## Technology Stack

- Go 1.24+ for the main application
- C for eBPF programs
- cilium/ebpf for loading eBPF programs
- Docker for containerization

## MCP Protocol Context

- MCP uses JSON-RPC 2.0 format
- Messages have jsonrpc: "2.0" field
- Three message types: Request, Response, Notification
- Track method names like "tools/call", "resources/read", etc.
- Focus on stdio transport.

## Performance Guidelines

- Use efficient data structures
- Minimize data copying between kernel and userspace
- Filter early in eBPF to reduce overhead

## Building

```bash
make build
```

## Running

```bash
sudo ./mcpspy

# It is must be stopped by sending SIGINT (Ctrl+C) or SIGTERM.
```

## Testing

```bash
make test-e2e
```

Testing creates a new execution of mcpspy, and runs a test client that simulates MCP traffic to an MCP server.
